Model 1 - Base plotting system
 - oldest system
 - build piece by piece
 - every plot is just a bunch of R code
 
 
 Model 2 - Lattice plotting system
 -  Single function with lots of parameters
 - Good for putting many plots on the screen
 - Has lots of default
 
  Model 3 - gg2 plot
    - Based on graphics grammar system
    - Mixes ideas from above 2 systems
    - has a different default aesthetic
    
Note: The 3 systems cannot be interchanged    

A good exploratory graph:
   1: To show causality, mechanism, explanation
   2: To show multivariate data
   3: To show comparisons

What is multivariate data you might ask? 
- In technical (scientific) literature this term means more than 2 variables. 
- Two-variable plots are what you saw in high school algebra.  Remember those x,y plots when you were learning about slopes and intercepts and equations of lines?
- They're valuable, but usually  questions are more complicated and require more variables.
