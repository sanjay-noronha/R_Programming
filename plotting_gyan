Model 1 - Base plotting system
 - oldest system
 - build piece by piece
 - every plot is just a bunch of R code
 
 
 Model 2 - Lattice plotting system
 -  Single function with lots of parameters
 - Good for putting many plots on the screen
 - Has lots of default
 
  Model 3 - gg2 plot
    - Based on graphics grammar system
    - Mixes ideas from above 2 systems
    - has a different default aesthetic
    
Note: The 3 systems cannot be interchanged    

A good exploratory graph:
   1. To show causality, mechanism, explanation
   2. To show multivariate data
   3. To show comparisons
   4. We DON'T use exploratory graphs to communicate results.
   5. Instead, exploratory graphs are the initial step in an investigation, the "quick and dirty" tool used to point the data scientist in a fruitful 
      direction. A scientist might need to make a lot of exploratory graphs in order to develop a personal understanding of the problem 
      being studied. Plot details such as axes, legends, color and size are cleaned up later to convey more information in an aesthetically pleasing way.

What is multivariate data you might ask? 
- In technical (scientific) literature this term means more than 2 variables. 
- Two-variable plots are what you saw in high school algebra.  Remember those x,y plots when you were learning about slopes and intercepts and equations of lines?
- They're valuable, but usually  questions are more complicated and require more variables.
- Beware Simpsons paradox

The fourth principle of analytic graphing involves integrating evidence. This means not limiting
yourself to one form of expression. You can use words, numbers, images as well as diagrams. Graphics
should make use of many modes of data presentation. Remember, "Don't let the tool drive the analysis!"

The sixth and final principle of analytic graphing is maybe the most important. Content is king! If you
don't have something interesting to report, your graphs won't save you. Analytical presentations
ultimately stand or fall depending on the quality, relevance, and integrity of their content.
