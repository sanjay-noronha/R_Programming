Overview:
--------
dplyr is a fast and powerful R package written by Hadley Wickham and Romain Francois  that provides a consistent and concise grammar for manipulating tabular data.
The dplyr philosophy is to have small functions that each do one thing well. Specifically, dplyr
supplies five 'verbs' that cover most fundamental data manipulation tasks: 
select(), filter(), arrange(), mutate(), and summarize()

One unique aspect of dplyr is that the same set of tools allow you to work with tabular data from a variety of sources, including data frames, data tables, databases and multidimensional
arrays.

* The first step of working with data in dplyr is to load the data into what the package authors call a 'data frame tbl' or 'tbl_df'
  The main advantage to using a tbl_df over a regular data frame is the printing.
  cran <- tbl_df(mydf)
