Key points:
==========

* The principles of tidy data are closely tied to those of relational databases and Codd’s relational algebra (Codd 1990), but are framed in a language familiar to statisticians.
* Like families, tidy datasets are all alike but every messy dataset is messy in its own way
* Most statistical datasets are rectangular tables made up of rows and columns. The columnsare almost always labelled and the rows are sometimes labelled
* A dataset is a collection of values, usually either numbers (if quantitative) or strings (ifqualitative). Values are organised in two ways. 
  Every value belongs to a variable and an observation.
* So what is tidy data?
  - In tidy data, each variable forms a column
  - Each observation forms a row. This is important in lieu of a pivot table.
  - Each type of observational unit forms a table
  - This is Codd’s 3rd normal form (Codd 1990), but with the constraints framed in statistical language
  - Fixed variables should come first, followed by measured variables, each ordered so that related variables are contiguous

* Types of MESSY datasets:
  - Column headers are values, not variable names [ Fixed by melting into key + value columns]
    - This is an example of a pivot table
    - Can be fixed with 2 new columns i.e. key and value
 -  Multiple variables stored in one column [ Fixed by melting and splitting ]
