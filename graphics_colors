* The default color schemes for most plots in R are not optimal.
* The function colors() represents the colors that we can use in a plotting function
*  The alpha value is great when you have overlapping points.

| Six vectors (each of length 3) are returned. The i-th vector is identical to
| output that would be returned by the call pal(i/5) for i=0,...5. We see that
| the i-th row (for i=1,...6) differs from the (i-1)-st row in the following
| way. Its red entry is 51 = 255/5 points lower and its blue entry is 51 points
| higher.


=====================
The RColorBrewer Package, available on CRAN, contains interesting and useful color palettes, of which there are 3
types, sequential, divergent, and qualitative. 
Which one you would choose to use depends on your data

 - Sequential palettes in which the colors are ordered from light to dark. 
 - Divergent palettes -  Here the neutral color (white) is in the center, and as you move from the middle to the two ends of each
   palette, the colors increase in intensity. T- 
- Qualitative palettes which look like collections of random colors. These might  be used to distinguish factors in your data
