- K means is an iterative algo
- Input:
  - number of clusters
  - the data e.g. (x, y)
  - random cluster centroid points

Logic:
- Assign random cluster centroids depending on number of clusters we want
- Now for each (x,y), assign to one of the above centroids
- Having done so, now calculate the mean of the (x,y) 's
- Now change the position of each cluster centroid to the new positions as per above means
- Repeat till clusters do not change.

What is the output of the K means algorithm?
 - Where are the cluster centroids?
 - With with cluster centroid is each (x,y) associated ?
 
Code:
> x <- sample(1:100, 20)
> y <- sample(1:100, 20)
> df <- data.frame(x,y)
> ggplot(df, aes(x,y)) + geom_point(colour = "blue") + geom_text(label = 1:20, nudge_y = 3, size = 3)
> k <- kmeans(df, centers = 3)
> library(dplyr)
> df <- mutate(df, cluster = k$cluster)
> ggplot(df, aes(x,y)) + geom_point(aes(colour = factor(cluster))) + geom_text(label = 1:20, nudge_y = 3, size = 3)
