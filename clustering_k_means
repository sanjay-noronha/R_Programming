- K means is an iterative algo
- Input:
  - number of clusters
  - the data e.g. (x, y)
  - random cluster centroid points

Logic:
- Assign random cluster centroids depending on number of clusters we want
- Now for each (x,y), assign to one of the above centroids
- Having done so, now calculate the mean of the (x,y) 's
- Now change the position of each cluster centroid to the new positions as per above means
- Repeat till clusters do not change.

What is the output of the K means algorithm?
 - Where are the cluster centroids?
 - With with cluster centroid is each (x,y) associated ?
