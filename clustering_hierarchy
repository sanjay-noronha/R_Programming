* The idea is to use clustering to visualize data
* To see which points are close, to group points
* The question is firstly what is close - eucliidian or other?


Steps:
* use rnorm() to get x and y
* use data.frame() to create df
* use dist() to get the distance between points
* use hclust() to get horizontal clustering
* use plot() to plut the above object
