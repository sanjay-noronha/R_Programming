* The idea is to use clustering to visualize data
* To see which points are close, to group points
* The question is firstly what is close - eucliidian or other?


Steps:
* use rnorm() to get x and y
* use data.frame() to create df
* use dist() to get the distance between points
* use hclust() to get horizontal clustering
* use plot() to plut the above object. A dendrogram.

x <- rnorm(12, mean = rep(1:3, each = 4), sd = 0.2)
y <- rnorm(12, mean = rep(1:3, each = 4), sd = 0.2)

plot(x,y, col = "blue", pch = 19) # view the data

df <- data.frame(x = x, y = y)

dist <- dist(df)

plot(hclust(dist))
