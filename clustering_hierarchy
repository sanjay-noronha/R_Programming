* The idea is to use clustering to visualize data
* To see which points are close, to group points
* The question is firstly what is close - eucliidian or other?


Steps:
* Create an x and y vector
> x<- sample(1:20, 20)
> y<- sample(1:20, 20)

* use data.frame() to create df
> df <- data.frame(x = x, y = y)

* use dist() to get the distance between points
distance <- dist(df)

* use hclust() to get horizontal clustering
* use plot() to plut the above object. A dendrogram.
plot(hclust(distance))
