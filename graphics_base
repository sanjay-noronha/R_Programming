- There are 2 phases to creating a base plot
a. Create a new  plot
b. Annotate an existing plot


- Base graphics package has many parameters that can be tweaked. To see them use ?par


- Examples
- get example datasets
  library(datasets)
  
- histogram
  with(airquality, hist(Ozone))
  
- scatterplot
  with(airquality, plot(Wind, Ozone))
  
- boxplot
  airquality <- transform(airquality, Month = factor(Month)) # convert month into a factor
  boxplot(Ozone ~ Month, airquality, xlab = "Month", ylab = "Ozone") # 1 box plot per group
  
  
- base graphics parameters
  * pch, xlab, ylab Etc
