- There are 2 phases to creating a base plot
a. Create a new  plot
b. Annotate an existing plot


- Base graphics package has many parameters that can be tweaked. To see them use ?par


- Examples
- get example datasets
  library(datasets)
  
- histogram
  with(airquality, hist(Ozone))
  rug(airquality) # a great function that adds a one dimension plot on the x-axis
  hist(ppm, col = "green", breaks = 100)
  
- scatterplot
  with(airquality, plot(Wind, Ozone))

- Add a label at a certain (x,y) on the scatterplot
  text(1, -2.75, "pappu")
  
- boxplot
  quantile(x), summary(x) -- provides percentile data in text format
  airquality <- transform(airquality, Month = factor(Month)) # convert month into a factor
  boxplot(Ozone ~ Month, airquality, xlab = "Month", ylab = "Ozone") # 1 box plot per group
  
  
- base graphics parameters
  * pch, xlab, ylab Etc

-- in this case I want a subset of data to have a different look and feel
-- also adding legend
with(airquality, plot(Ozone, Wind, main = "Title goes here"))
par(new=TRUE) # do not clean the frame between plots
with(subset(airquality, Month ==5), plot(Wind, Ozone, col = "blue"))
legend("topright", pch = 1, col = c("blue", "red"), legend = c("May", "Other months"))

-- plot a scatter plot of the data
-- then add a regression line

with(airquality, plot(Ozone, Wind)) # plot the scatterplot
par(new = TRUE) # hold on to the plot
model <- lm(Wind ~ Ozone, airquality) # fit a liner model
abline(model) # plot the line
abline(v= median(ppm), col = "magenta", lwd = 4) # simple vertical line at the median

-- Multi base plots
  par(mfrow = c(1, 2))
  with(airquality,{
    plot(Ozone, Wind, main = "Ozone v. Wind")
    plot(Ozone, Solar.R, main = "Ozone v. Solar R")
  })


--Another example to show the difference between plot() and points() + subsetting
-- Factors in R are stored as a vector of integer values with a corresponding set of character values to use when the factor is displayed
x <- rnorm(100)
y <- rnorm(100)
g <- gl(2, 50, labels = c("male", "female"))
plot(x, y, type = "n")
points(x[g == "male"], y[g == "male"])
points(x[g == "female"], y[g == "female"], pch = 20, col = "red")


-- Writing to a graphical device
> pdf("sanjay.pdf") # open device
> plot(x,y)
> title(main = "pappu")
> dev.off() # close device
