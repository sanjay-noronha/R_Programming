- There are 2 phases to creating a base plot
a. Create a new  plot
b. Annotate an existing plot


- Base graphics package has many parameters that can be tweaked. To see them use ?par


- Examples
- get example datasets
  library(datasets)
  
- histogram
  with(airquality, hist(Ozone))
  
- scatterplot
  with(airquality, plot(Wind, Ozone))
  
- boxplot
  airquality <- transform(airquality, Month = factor(Month)) # convert month into a factor
  boxplot(Ozone ~ Month, airquality, xlab = "Month", ylab = "Ozone") # 1 box plot per group
  
  
- base graphics parameters
  * pch, xlab, ylab Etc

-- in this case I want a subset of data to have a different look and feel
-- also adding legend
with(airquality, plot(Ozone, Wind, main = "Title goes here"))
par(new=TRUE) # do not clean the frame between plots
with(subset(airquality, Month ==5), plot(Wind, Ozone, col = "blue"))
legend("topright", pch = 1, col = c("blue", "red"), legend = c("May", "Other months"))

-- plot a scatter plot of the data
-- then add a regression line

with(airquality, plot(Ozone, Wind)) # plot the scatterplot
par(new = TRUE) # hold on to the plot
model <- lm(Wind ~ Ozone, airquality) # fit a liner model
abline(model) # plot the line

-- Multi base plots
  par(mfrow = c(1, 2))
  with(airquality,{
    plot(Ozone, Wind, main = "Ozone v. Wind")
    plot(Ozone, Solar.R, main = "Ozone v. Solar R")
  })
